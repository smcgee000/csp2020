	<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>
	<p1> Hello! My name is Shane McGee, I'm currently a junior at Waukesha North High School.
	<br> I was born October 20th, 2003, in waukesha and I have lived here my whole life. 
	<br> This year in school I aim to pass all my classes with A's and keep working at my long term goal of being Valedictorian.
	<br> Along with staying competitive in the class run I also stay competive as a distance runner, running both CC and track.
	<br> Outside of school my two biggest hobbies are movies and music. I love watching as many movies as possible and stay cultured.
	<br> Along with watching movies I love recording/playing music. My main instruments are guitar and bass
	<br> My favorite genre of music is Indie, I just personally love the vibes that kind of music gives off.
	<br>
